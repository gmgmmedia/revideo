## Usage Tips for ElevenLabs

1. **Copy the prompt text between backticks** (the text after "ElevenLabs Prompt")
2. **Adjust duration** in ElevenLabs to match the Duration column
3. **Layer sounds** - some moments benefit from 2-3 subtle sounds stacked
4. **Consistent volume** - keep all sounds at similar levels for mixing flexibility
5. **Leave headroom** - subtle sounds are easier to boost than loud sounds to reduce

## Project-Specific Instructions

When creating sound design for a specific project:

1. **Match the visual style** - Minimal visuals = minimal sounds
2. **Sync to visual beats** - Sounds should land on animation keyframes
3. **Build tension/resolution** - Use builds before key moments
4. **Layer for richness** - Background ambience + foreground events
5. **Avoid clutter** - Not every visual needs a sound
